		"How code slows as data grows."
		
		1. Describes the performance of an algorithm as the amount of data increases
		2. Machine independent (# of steps to completion)
		3. Ignore smaller operations O(n + 1) -> O(n)
		
		example:							n = amount of data
			O(1)							(It's a variable like x)
			O(n)
			O(log n)
			O(n^2)
			
			//-------------- Execution time increasing order (BottomMost is extreamly slow)
		
			O(1)  = constant time 
					* random access of an element in an array
					* inserting at the begining of likedlist
					
			O(log n) = logarithmic time
					   * binary search
					   
			O(n) = linear Time
				   * looping through elements in an array
				   * searching through a linkedlist
				   
			O(n log n) = quasilinear time
						 * quicksort
						 * mergesort 
						 * heapsort
						 
			O(n^2) = quadratic time
					 * insertion sort 
					 * selection sort 
					 * bubble sort 
					 
		    O(n!) = factorial time
		    		* Traveling Salesman problem
